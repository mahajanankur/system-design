 *          Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of
 *          the singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded,
 *          SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when
 *          someone calls the getInstance method, this class gets loaded and
 *          creates the Singleton class instance. This is the most widely used
 *          approach for Singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.
